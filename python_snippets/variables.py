wiki = """Interstate 82 (I-82) is an Interstate Highway 
        in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States 
        that passes through parts of Washington and Oregon. 
        It runs southeasterly for 144 miles (232 km) from 
        I-90 in Ellensburg, Washington, to I-84 in Hermiston, 
        Oregon. The highway passes through Yakima, the 
        Yakima Valley agricultural region, and the 
        Tri-Cities area, also serving as part of the 
        link between Seattle and Boise, Idaho. 
        It crosses the Columbia River on the Umatilla Bridge (pictured), 
        which opened in 1955 and was later twinned. 
        The corridor was originally used by several state 
        and national highways until I-82 was created in 
        late 1957. The first section to be constructed was 
        a bypass of Yakima, opened in 1963, which was 
        extended north to Ellensburg on November 12, 1971.
        Valley section, connecting Union Gap to Prosser, 
        was constructed between 1977 and 1982. 
        The Tri-Cities bypass opened in 1986, 
        delayed by a lengthy routing dispute, and the 
        final section was completed in 1988.
